## 🧾 Licensing Snippet Instructions

### 📍 Instructions from WhatsApp — *2025-05-26* (for **ZambaBet**)

> **Dear Client,**
>
> Please find below the newly issued validation code snippet for **["zamba.bet"]**.
> The snippet will visualize the **Anjouan Licensing Services Inc.** logo.
> This is a **mandatory requirement** and the snippet should be presented **at all times in the website footer**.
>
> You can easily position or resize it by styling an outside container element around it.
> It’s important to add it in the **same order** that is provided below — the `<div>` tag should be added **first**, and **right after it** the `<script>` tag.
>
> ```html
> <div
>   id="anj-baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b"
>   data-anj-seal-id="baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b"
>   data-anj-image-size="128"
>   data-anj-image-type="basic-small">
> </div>
> <script
>   type="text/javascript"
>   src="https://baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b.snippet.anjouangaming.org/anj-seal.js">
> </script>
> ```
>
> ---
>
> In case the website footer is generated by a **client-side framework** (e.g. AngularJS, ReactJS, etc), please ignore the above guide and follow these simple instructions:
>
> 1. **Add the script to the `<head>` of the HTML**
>
>    ```html
>    <script
>      type="text/javascript"
>      src="https://baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b.snippet.anjouangaming.org/anj-seal.js">
>    </script>
>    ```
>
> 2. **Add the logo container to your client-side template**
>
>    ```html
>    <div
>      id="anj-baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b"
>      data-anj-seal-id="baee18f7-63ae-4aa0-b5d7-8160149e921b"
>      data-anj-image-size="128"
>      data-anj-image-type="basic-small">
>    </div>
>    ```
>
> 3. **Execute the init hook** inside your framework’s component lifecycle method:
>
>    ```js
>    anj_baee18f7_63ae_4aa0_b5d7_8160149e921b.init();
>    ```
>
>    *(e.g., for AngularJS 1/2 this would be inside `onInit()`)*
>
> ---
>
> **NOTE:**
> If the licensed website requires login credentials for access and it is in production state,
> you are required to add the snippet on **both the login page** and **the site footer**.
>
> ---
>
> **Commonly seen issues:**
>
> * If the footer is generated by a client-side framework and the logo is not visible even though:
>
>   * the `<div>` and `<script>` tags are added, **and**
>   * the init hook is executed
>
>   → Ensure all elements are added according to the above instructions and the init hook runs correctly.
>   To verify, open **Developer Tools → Console** and manually execute:
>
>   ```js
>   anj_baee18f7_63ae_4aa0_b5d7_8160149e921b.init();
>   ```
>
>   If the logo appears after that, then the element was missing or initialized incorrectly.
